# Fifty50 Challenge

[Here's the website](https://fifty50.vercel.app)

I made this website to improve my web development skills, it was inspired by the Fifty Fifty challenge that was popular in 2016. I used Reddit's api to get posts form <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FiftyFifty/" target="_blank">r/FiftyFifty</a> and display it on my website. I've also added a "Memes" and "Clean my eyes" button that fetches posts from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/" target="_blank">r/Memes</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/eyebleach/" target="_blank">r/eyebleach</a> in case you need it. There's also an easter egg, see if can figure it out.
